# Project Title: 
Sales Performance Dashboard using SQL, Power BI, and Excel
# Project Description:
In this data analyst project, I designed and developed a comprehensive Sales Performance Dashboard using a combination of SQL for data extraction and transformation, Power BI for visualization, and Excel for additional analysis. The primary objective of the project was to provide actionable insights to the sales team, enabling them to make informed decisions and enhance overall sales performance.

# Project Highlights:

Data Collection and Integration (SQL): I extracted sales data from multiple sources, including transaction databases and spreadsheets, using SQL queries. I ensured data accuracy, consistency, and completeness by performing data cleansing and joining relevant tables.

Data Modeling and Transformation (SQL): Utilizing SQL, I transformed raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis. This involved aggregating sales data by various dimensions such as time, products, regions, and customer segments, creating a robust foundation for the dashboard.

Power BI Dashboard Design: I designed a user-friendly and interactive Sales Performance Dashboard in Power BI, featuring insightful visualizations, charts, and key performance indicators (KPIs). The dashboard provided a holistic view of sales trends, product performance, regional comparisons, and customer behavior.

Excel Integration: To augment the dashboard's capabilities, I integrated Excel functionalities for advanced analysis. This allowed users to perform what-if scenarios, perform deeper data exploration, and create custom reports based on the dashboard's underlying data.

Automation and Data Refresh: I established an automated process to refresh the data in the dashboard at regular intervals, ensuring that the sales team always had access to the most up-to-date information without manual intervention.

User Training and Documentation: I conducted training sessions for the sales team on how to use the dashboard effectively, interpret the visualizations, and leverage Excel features. Additionally, I provided comprehensive documentation, enabling users to navigate the dashboard and troubleshoot common issues.

The Sales Performance Dashboard proved to be a valuable tool for the sales team, empowering them to identify growth opportunities, track sales targets, and make data-driven decisions. The combination of SQL, Power BI, and Excel provided a seamless and powerful solution, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the sales process.
